"""The science the desktop runs locally.

A thin, deliberately narrow seam onto `moltrace.spectroscopy`. It exists so the
local service can serve `fid.process` without importing the cloud API's
dependency tree — which carries authorization, the database session factory, and
the query-parameter credential acceptor the desktop profile is required to
remove.

**The property that makes this servable offline is that it needs nothing.** No
database, no network, no authorization: it takes arrays in and returns numbers
out. That is asserted by test rather than assumed, because the moment it acquires
a dependency on any of the three it stops being an offline operation and the
policy table's classification becomes wrong.

It returns a plain summary rather than the engine's own `Peak`. The engine type
is free to grow fields — provenance, internal confidences, fitting diagnostics —
and a transport that forwards whatever it is given would publish them the day
they appear. This lists what crosses the boundary.
